# number_of_order_prediction

This project aims to **predict the number of orders** using various machine learning models, based on input features such as weather, temperature, humidity, and other relevant variables. The solution is built using Python and the Scikit-learn library.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

In this notebook:
- We explore the data using visualizations to understand underlying patterns.
- Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for modeling.
- Train multiple regression models to predict the number of orders.
- Evaluate models using appropriate performance metrics.

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

- Distribution plots (`sns.histplot`)
- Correlation heatmaps
- Feature vs. target scatter plots
- Residual error visualizations

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

- RÂ² Score
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
